Clicking the link opens a very basic website with preview text 'snickerdoodle'. Entering snickerdoodle we go to another page. Inspecting the cookie received using a cookie editor plugin in firefox, we see the value of this cookie is 0. By changing this value, we can iterate through the cookies.  

changing the value to 18 gets us the flag.
