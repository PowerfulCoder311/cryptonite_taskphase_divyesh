### Challenge: 
Can you get the flag? We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

As we see, the website is filtering absolute file paths. /usr/share/nginx/html/flag.txt gives the error "not authorised"

Therefore we have to reach the flag using alternate methods.
Examining the packets, we see there's no payload for the requests sent. Which rules out XML injection.
Remembering the concepts from Task Phase 1, Module 2 (Pondering Paths) I tried using (..) to keep moving to the next directory to reach the flag using relative paths.
So /usr/share/nginx/html/flag.txt becomes ../../../../../flag.txt 

This gives us the flag!
