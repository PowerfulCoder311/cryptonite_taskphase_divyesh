Challenge: Decode this message from the moon.  
Downloading the file, we see its a .wav file, which is used to store uncompressed audio files. Further researching, we stumble upon sstv (slow scan television) , a method to transfer still images using sound. 
We must decode the wav file using sstv and retrieve the image.  

To decode, I downloaded qsstv. Downloading:
```
