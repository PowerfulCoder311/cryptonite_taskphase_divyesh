This challenge requires us recover the original text using the encoder, basically creating the decoder.
The encoder:
```
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur

sys.stdout.write(out)
```
explanation of the encoder: The encoder takes input from the user then iterates throuth it with the variable char. it then looks for the element (char) in lookup1 and then returns the character from lookup2 whose index is [ index of current element in lookup1-index of previous element in lookup1 mod 40].

if decoded element is lookup2[(cur-prev)%40], original element would be lookup1[(cur+prev)+40]
letting the original element into prev and then adding this original element into out string we get the decoder
##### DECODER:
```
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup2.index(char)
  originalElement = lookup1[(cur + prev) % 40]
  out+=originalElement
  prev = lookup1.index(originalElement)

sys.stdout.write(out)
```
inputting the ciphertext into this script, we get the following message:
```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```
which is another python program. one of the comments is self input and other is python2. I see that in print statement, brackets are not given therefore this program will result in error in python3. My mac doesnt have python 2. Trying out using python3 by adding the brackets we get output yadlibn which is not the flag, Therefore it has to be executed using python2.
